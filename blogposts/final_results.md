After some last fine tuning and cleaning up of our code we are finally done with our Boids implementation.
In the Gif Below you see 100 boids following a set of three movement rules - Flock Centering, Velocity Matching, and Collision Avoidance, to simulate flocking behaviour.

_The white sphere denotes the middle of the bounded area the boids are allowed to fly within._

### Future improvements

Numerous enhancements could be made to expand upon this project. Currently, the simulation features a basic flock navigating within a confined area. An immediate improvement could involve incorporating obstacle avoidance to enable navigation around various objects within the scene. Additionally, developing a predator-prey dynamic could add an interactive element, allowing users to control the predator.

Further development could also transform the simulation into a more visually appealing environment by improving the background aesthetics and refining the boids to resemble actual birds, complete with wing-flapping animations.
